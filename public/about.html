<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I'm Julie Ann Nailon, and I'm passionate about all things horror. On this site, you'll find my top three favorite 
  horror movies of all time, along with an invitation to my birthday celebration.</p>

  <p>
  Let's Celebrate! <br />
  Join me as I celebrate my birthday on 8th December. It's going to be a spooky good time, filled with thrills, 
  chills, and maybe even a few screams!
  </p>
  
  <p>I'd love for you to join in the frightful fun. Please RSVP to let me know you're coming.</p>
  
  <p>Thanks for stopping by, and I hope to see you at the party!</p>
