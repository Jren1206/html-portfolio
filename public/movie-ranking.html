<h1>The Best Horror Movies According to Julie Ann</h1>
<h2>My top 3 horror movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>THE EXORCIST (1973)</h3>
<p>The scariest movie of all time.</p>
<h3>THE CONJURING (2013)</h3>
<p> It has tension, a story, and some real intrigue, possibly because of the fact that it was inspired by real life events.</p>
<h3>INSIDIOUS (2010)</h3>
<p> Insidious has a lot of really intense moments that scare, and then grab hold of you..</p>
